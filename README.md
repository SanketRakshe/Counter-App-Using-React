# React Counter Example

This project demonstrates a basic counter functionality in a React application using the `useState` hook. The counter allows users to increment and decrement a numerical value by clicking on the respective buttons.

## Project Structure

- **App.jsx**: The main component containing the counter logic.
- **index.css**: Basic styles for the application.
- **package.json**: Lists the project dependencies and scripts.
- **package-lock.json**: Locks the exact versions of project dependencies.

## Features

- **Increment Counter**: Increases the count value by 1 each time the "Increment" button is clicked.
- **Decrement Counter**: Decreases the count value by 1 each time the "Decrement" button is clicked.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd your-repo-name
   ```
```
3. Install the dependencies:

```
## Usage
